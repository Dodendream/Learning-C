Problem: 
The number S is called the mean of two numbers R1 and R2 if S is equal to (R1+R2)/2. 
Mirko's birthday present for Slavko was two integers R1 and R2. 
Slavko promptly calculated their mean which also happened to be an integer but then lost R2! Help Slavko restore R2. 

-input 
*The first and only line of input contains two integers R1 and S, both between -1000 and 1000.

-output
*Output R2 on a single line. 

-Example input                                                                -Example output 
*11 15                                                                          *19

My Code
#include<cstdio>
int main()
{
    int a,S;
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&S);
     int c = S*2;
     int d = c-a;
     printf("%d",d);
}
